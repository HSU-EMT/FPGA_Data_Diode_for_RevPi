<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A new FPGA based approach for a data diode
transmitting data unidirectionally from a high security zone
to a lower security zone has been evaluated and implemented.
With the FPGA implementation, the need of additional hardware
could be minimized compared to most state-of-the-art data
diode realizations. The proposed data diode is designed to use
the available backplane bus communication protocol between
the programmable logic controller (PLC) and its connected
peripherals. To demonstrate the universal approach an opensource
platform based on the Revolution Pi (RevPi) and its
backplane bus has been used. Principally the data diode behaves
as a mirror presenting the complete protected system behind the
high security zone including the RevPi PLC controller and its
devices to the IT network. Another controller within the lower
security zone is used to imitate the OT process. Our approach
is not limited to the above controller and can be applied to any
type of programmable logic controller. The only requirement is
that the communication protocol on the backplane bus is known
and can be modified if needed, which is usually the case for the
PLC manufacturer or if an Open PLC is employed.

## Instructions

<!-- Hardware -->
#### Hardware

1. First, the RevPi modules are connected together via [PiBridge](https://revolutionpi.com/pibridge/). The figure below is the PiBridge connector and its pin assignment. A total of 3 PiBridge connectors are required. In which 2 connectors are uncapped so that they can be soldered to wires.

  </a>
</div>

2. The diagram below shows how hardware devices are connected to each other. The author recommends readers to go through manual reference of the Zybo Z7-20 board [here](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/zybo-z7/reference-manual?redirect=1) and RS-485 Pmod [here](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodrs485/reference-manual) so that the diagram below can be easily understood. JF, JD or JC are the Pmod ports on the board. Where 0, 9, 10 and 13 are the numbers of the used pins. The Pibridge pins are connected to Revpi modules or soldered to wires. The other end of these wires is connected to the pins of the Pmod ports or the pins of the RS-485 Pmods. Two 100kOhm resistors are used to create the pull-down connections. Two RevPi Connect have been selected as controller modules, denoted as PLC and PLC-Mirror (PLCM). A RevPi DIO module is connected to the PLC on the left side.

3. [Power supply](https://revolutionpi.com/tutorials/uebersicht-revpi-connect/spannungsversorgung-anschliessen-connect/) for circuit boards and RevPi devices. Connect 2 controller modules via LAN cable to your laptop to be able to configure RevPi modules in PiCtory. See [here](https://revolutionpi.com/tutorials/uebersicht-revpi-connect/) and [here](https://revolutionpi.com/tutorials/was-ist-pictory-2/) for more details.

4. In PiCtory, two DIO modules and one RevPi Connect are configured for each PLC and PLCM. The DIO module next to the RevPi Connect is set to default. The leftmost DIO module activates 6 counter channels as shown below.

<!-- Software -->
#### Software

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `project_1.xpr` with Vivado. All IP cores and pin assignments have been designed. Click the button ``Generate Bitstream``. After bitstream has been created. Click on ``File`` -> ``Export`` -> ``Export Hardware``. Navigate to the folder ``applications`` and check on ``Include Bitstream``. Then click ``OK``.
3. Click on ``File`` -> ``Launch SDK``. Navigate to the folder ``applications`` for ``Exported location`` and ``Workspace``. Then click ``OK``. The SDK application will be opened.
4. In SDK, click on ``File`` -> ``Open Projects From File System`` and add folder ``core0``, ``core0_bsp``, ``core1``, ``core1_bsp``in the folder ``applications`` into workspace.
5. Right click on ``core1_bsp``. Select ``Board Support Package Setting``. There, add ``-DUSE_AMP`` for ``extra_compiler_flag`` of ``ps7_cortexa9_1``. This allows the use of interrupt controllers for multicore processors in Zynq, like [here](https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/62557?language=en_US).
6. Run two applications ``main_core1.c`` on processor core 1 and ``main_core0.c`` on processor core 0. If you are not familiar with it, we recommend that you check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0hbwp36hBs&t=412s).
7. Reset PLC and PLCM in PicTory. Note that PLC must be reset first. See [Documentation](https://github.com/HSU-EMT/DataDiode_based_on_RevolutionPI/blob/main/others/doc/README.md) for the reason.

<!-- Test -->
## Test


To test the setup, we connect 2 controllers to the laptop via SSH, e.g. with the [``Putty``](https://www.putty.org/) app, and use the ``piTest`` program like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug8WJmfFjYY) or [here](https://revolutionpi.com/tutorials/software/pitest-verwenden/). Change the value of any output or input variable of the DIO module next to PLC module in ``piTest`` running on PLC and read this change in ``piTest`` running on PLCM. If the change is successfully transferred, it means that your setup was successful.

  </a>
</div>

The output value of the real I/O modules connected to the PLC is stored on response packet of the data diode (Fig. 5 in [Documentation](https://github.com/HSU-EMT/DataDiode_based_on_RevolutionPI/blob/main/others/doc/README.md)), namely on the bytes of the counter channel of the data diode (leftmost DIO module in PiCtory). Therefore, when read by ``piTest``, its name has the form Counter_N_... by default, where N is the number of the counter channel, which corresponds to the number of the real I/O module (counted from the PLC to outside). You can change the names of these variables in ``PiCtory`` as you wish.

For more details, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/HSU-EMT/DataDiode_based_on_RevolutionPI/blob/main/others/doc/README.md).


## Notes

1. You can also connect more I/O modules to PLC module. The process data of these I/O modules will be automatically transmitted to PLCM. For more details, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/HSU-EMT/DataDiode_based_on_RevolutionPI/blob/main/others/doc/README.md).
2. The size of the response packet of the data diode can be changed by setting the number of active counter channels for the DIO module emulated by the data diode in PiCtory (leftmost DIO module in PiCtory). Each counter channel corresponds to four bytes and up to six counter channels are possibly active at the same time, corresponds to 24 free bytes to store output value of the real I/O modules. Because of the limited number of these bytes, we had to limit some features of real I/O modules connected to PLC to restrict their output value length, such as: Do not use PWM features for DO,DIO modules; do not use MIO modules. We will try to remove these limitations in the next data diode version.
3. In the PiCtory, users must set the feature of the I/O modules connected to PLCM and the corresponding I/O modules connected to PLC identically to minimize the difference in cycle time between the two networks during the cyclic data exchange phase.
4. We are still improving the code and developing the project. Please report bugs if you find them.
